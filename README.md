# Tower Defense Game
 I'm making this Tower Defense game as a way to improve my game dev and have fun, I'm working on it as a side project while juggling university and work, so don't expect incredibly frequent updates, but I try to work on it every few days or so at least. The scope isn't too big and so once I feel like I am done with it I might upload to itch.io.

More details coming soon!
